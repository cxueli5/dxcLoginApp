# Note to assessors
Hello! I am Chan Xue Li. As this is an assessment, I would like to be honest with the recruiters, even if there is a risk that I would not be chosen because of this note. <br>

I only learnt Java in University for one of my modules (Object-Oriented Programming) and my professor only taught us console-based UI as he wanted us to work on our Java Skills. <br>

I haven't learn how to do UI with Java backend before. Hence, I would like to show the skills which I have learnt instead of copying and pasting online templates to try and make it work.<br>

If there is an opportunity, I would like to learn more from the company. However, if I failed the assessment due to the lack of skills, I would still like to thank you for this opportunity! :)
